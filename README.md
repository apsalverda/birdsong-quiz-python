# Birdsong Quiz

This app allows you to practice identifying birds by ear using recordings from [Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Macauley Library](https://www.macaulaylibrary.org).

### important requirements

You must own [a set of audio files](https://www.macaulaylibrary.org/product/the-cornell-guide-to-bird-sounds-us-and-canada/) purchased from Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Macauley library.
In the folder with the app, create a folder named "sounds". Copy all audio files (.mp3s) that you want to practice for to this folder. **The app only works for these recordings**.

### how the app works
The app plays a recording randomly selected from all recordings in the `/sounds` folder.
If you want to hear the sound again, click `Repeat`.
Once you think you know you have identified the species that produced the sound, you can click `Reveal` to show a picture of the bird along with some additional information.
When you are ready to go to the next item, click `Next`. After the app has played all the sounds in the `sounds` folder, it will start over again.
